    <h1>Welcome to OurOS#</h1>
    <p>The open-source, ultra-customizable, terminal-focused OS designed for real programmers.</p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>‚öôÔ∏è Built for Coders, by a Coder</h2>
    <p>
      OurOS# isn‚Äôt just another Linux distro. It‚Äôs a full programming-focused operating system built from scratch, designed to deliver pure terminal power, minimalist design, and maximum developer productivity.
    </p>

    <h2>üñ•Ô∏è Raw Terminal Power</h2>
    <p>
      Forget bloated UIs and flashy icons ‚Äî OurOS# is a shell-only beast. Every command, every tool, and every script is designed to give developers instant, keyboard-driven access to what they need most. Open your editor, compile code in multiple languages, run WebAssembly, C++, C#, and even launch a real mechanical clock ‚Äî all from one unified shell.
    </p>

    <h2>üîê Hacker‚Äôs Playground</h2>
    <p>
      With built-in tools for debugging, custom scripting, direct hardware control, and networking, OurOS# gives you access under the hood. It‚Äôs like Arch Linux and LFS had a child ‚Äî but this time, it‚Äôs built with your vision.
    </p>

    <h2>üíª 100% Open Source & Community Driven</h2>
    <p>
      OurOS# is completely open-source and hosted on GitHub, allowing you to fork it, improve it, or even create your own version of the system. Programmers of all ages ‚Äî especially teens who want to learn ‚Äî are encouraged to contribute and make something epic.
    </p>

    <h2>üöÄ Custom Commands & Developer Tools</h2>
    <p>
      Imagine typing <code>ourclock</code>, <code>ourcalc</code>, <code>ouredit</code>, and instantly using tools designed *only* for OurOS#. Everything is fast, smooth, and tailored for developers who want full control over their machine.
